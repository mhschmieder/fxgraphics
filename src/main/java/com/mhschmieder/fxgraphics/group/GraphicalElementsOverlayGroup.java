/**
 * This is a Group container for all the Graphical Elements that will display
 * over a Cartesian Chart background or a Canvas. Usually these are the shapes
 * representing interactive application domain objects.
 * <p>
 * It is important to manage any connection the associated shapes (generally
 * added as ShapeGroup wrappers) have with application domain objects. This is
 * a Group container, so it is only appropriate (and scalable) to have it store
 * the generated graphics for such objects. The application must maintain the
 * mouse interaction, contextual scaling updates, etc. This is just a container
 * and is here for convenience so that such graphics can be handled similarly to
 * other overlay groups, such as generated images from visualization calls.
